# Product-Identification-In-The-Shelf-Image-Of-The-Retail-Store
Developed and compared deep learning models (ResNet50, MobileNetv2, DenseNet169) for accurate product classification in retail shelf images under varied conditions like lighting, angles, and occlusions. Implemented YOLOv8 using Roboflow specifically for high-precision product detection, achieving robust performance in complex scenarios. Created an efficient system using OpenCV to process images faster, cutting down prediction time and making the overall system work more smoothly. Integrated a user interface (UI) for improved functionality and userÂ experience.

## Features

- **Full-Stack Application**: Includes both the frontend and backend, providing an end-to-end solution for grocery product identification.
- **TensorFlow Models**: Uses advanced models (ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and DenseNet169) to classify images and predict the correct product.
- **Image Processing**: Optimized image preprocessing for fast and accurate predictions.
- **FastAPI Backend**: A FastAPI server that serves the models and handles all predictions.
- **React Frontend**: A simple, user-friendly interface that allows easy image uploads and model selection.

## UI Collaboration

The UI part of the system was developed in collaboration with my friend. For detailed structure and code, refer to their repository:
