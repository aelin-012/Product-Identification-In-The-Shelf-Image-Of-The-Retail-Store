# Product-Identification-In-The-Shelf-Image-Of-The-Retail-Store
Developed and compared deep learning models (ResNet50, MobileNetv2, DenseNet169) for accurate product classification in retail shelf images under varied conditions like lighting, angles, and occlusions. Implemented YOLOv8 using Roboflow specifically for high-precision product detection, achieving robust performance in complex scenarios. Created an efficient system using OpenCV to process images faster, cutting down prediction time and making the overall system work more smoothly. Integrated a user interface (UI) for improved functionality and userÂ experience.
